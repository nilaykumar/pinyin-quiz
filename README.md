# pinyin

listening quiz, meant to practice pinyin

the audio files are taken from
[here](https://github.com/shikangkai/Chinese-Pinyin-Audio), which seems to trace
back, at least in part, to [here](https://www.uvm.edu/~chinese/pinyin.htm)

## to do

- make it less ugly
- diff the male and female files -- why are there more female syllables? are
  some male missing?
- switch randomly between male and female
- clean up audio? find better (open source) files?
